This repository is a practice repo for building a RESTful API using Express JS, MongoDB and Nodemon.

To test this API, I used Postman to attach data to each of the CRUD routes.

## How To Install

Run `npm i express nodemon mongoose` to install ExpressJS, Mongoose & Nodemon.

## How To Use

Type `npm start` to run the server. The port is currently `3000`.

The server is not live for all to use, so you will need to create a cluster locally with MongoDB.

Use `Postman` to send get, post, patch and delete requests.

## Future Updates

I would love to have a dynamic webpage to search within the page itself instead of using Postman.
